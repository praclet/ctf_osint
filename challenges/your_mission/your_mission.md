## Message

Dear Agents,

Last week, a hacker sent a message to the agency. They call themselves 'le Grand Architecte du Tout' and threatened to attack the famous school 42 in two days.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find anything that could help stop this evil hacker. What are they looking for? What is their goal? The very survival of 42 depends on your success.
No pressure.

Before starting, read the rules.

Good luck! And most important: have fun!

## Solution

Read the rules.
