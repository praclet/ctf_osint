## Message

Good job! You discovered what seems to be the Twitter account of 'le Grand Architecte du Tout'. We need more information to identify them. We asked school 42 staff to start searching in their database. The hacker could be a former student. What do you think? Can you check if they have an account on any code hosting platform?

To solve this challenge, submit the account URL without `https://` and without terminating slash.

## Solution

Find the HTB accound of adriana in a twitter thread. A Github account is linked on the HTB profile.
