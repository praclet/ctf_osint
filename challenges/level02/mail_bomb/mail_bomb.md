## Message
Agent have you seen all this data ?  
Too bad most of it are spam-like e-mail, maybe with a secret trick of yours, you can find something intresting ?  
Maybe an e-mail addressed to Edward for example...

To solve this challenge, submit the flag as follows: APT{sha256(info)}  
For exemple if My_Flag is the info:  
echo -n My_Flag | sha256sum

APT{f8fa66e084281bb87f40b2f7048ceb93c28dd6e282f98f43a2cd4396245a7404}
