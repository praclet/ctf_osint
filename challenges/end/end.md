Congratulations Agent!

TODO Vous avez déjoué les plans bla bla bla

Let's see!

"Bravo. Bravo to you. You did swim well. It's time for the reward!

I am angry. I am so ANGRY towards 42.  
I took the Piscine in 2013. I passed. I reached level 21 and beyond.

Everything was going so well.  
I was so cute and nice at that time. Had never worn a black hoodie yet. Had never coded any malware yet. Can you believe???? I was the cutest of all.

Then, one day, HE appeared.  
HE became everyone's favorite.  
Everyone loved him, talked about him all the time.

Did you guess who HE is?

Norminet! Of course!

Cats are evil.

I left 42. Couldn't stay near this devilish creature. He looks so cute, but make no mistake about it: HE'S NOT.

Join the dark side! Join me! Join the dog people! Don't be a cat person!!"
